    <h1>Amuse Me</h1>
    <h2>Find the Invisible Cow</h2>
    <p>There is an invisble cow on this website that you must find only using the sound of someone's voice saying the word "cow." <em>Surpisingly</em> fun, weird, and you can unlock animals as you rack up points!</p>

     <h2>Hacker Typer</h2>
    <p>This one is a bit silly, but I thought it perfect for the class as we are coding! Basically it's a website where no matter what you type, it comes out as code that looks like you're hacking online! It reminds of The Matrix with it's black and green coding and it's fun to just randomly type anything on the page and it comes out legible!</p>

     <h2>The Useless Web</h2>
    <p>This one is a pretty simple website with one button that takes you all over the internet! As soon as you click the button, it takes you to a random, useless internet page that has weird images or actions! It's fun if you're bored!</p>
