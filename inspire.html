        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>To me, Kamala Harris has always been an inspiration because of where she has come from and how she has learned to overcome and perservere. She's always been an idol of mine, even when she was a District Attorney, and she continues to grow with support due to her recent presediential candidacy. </p>
